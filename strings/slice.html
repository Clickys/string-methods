    'use strict'
    // Main Objective
    // The slice() method extracts a section of a string and returns it as a new string, without modifying the original string.

    // Function signature 
    // slice(originalString, beginIndex, [, endIndex]);

    // Function Parameters 
    // beginIndex -> The zero-based index at which to begin extraction.
    // endIndex -> The zero-based index before which to end extraction.

    // Return value 
    // A new string containing the extracted section of the string.

    // It should not modify the originalString
    // If negative, it is treated as strLength + endIndex where strLength is the length of the string (for example, if endIndex is -3 it is treated as strLength - 3).

    // Requirements 
    // 1. It should have a beginIndex as first function argument which to begin extracation and return a new string.
    // 2. If beginIndex is negative it is treated as originalString.length + beginIndex where originalString is the length of the string. 
    // 3. If beginIndex is greater than or equal to the length of the string, slice() returns an empty string.
    // 4. It should have an optional endIndex which is where to end extracation which the endIndex will not included to the new string.
    // 5. If endIndex is negative, it is treated as originalString.length + endIndex where strLength is the length of the string.
    // 6. If endIndex is omitted, slice() extracts to the end of the string.
    // 7. It should not modify the string that was called upon.
